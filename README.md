## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Again, there wasn't much that I can say I learned this time around. However, this project was very useful as practice for things like styling of HTML tables and lists, as well as element sizing, positioning, etc.


### Continued development

Use of media queries to make pages more responsive. While I was somewhat able to match the mobile design reasonably well, my solution was not perfect nor elegant, so I'd like to keep polishin my skills in that regard.
